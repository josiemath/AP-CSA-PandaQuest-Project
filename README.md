# AP-CSA-PandaQuest-Project

🐼 **An educational game for learning Java and Object-Oriented Programming with Greenfoot!**

## About

PandaQuest is a fun, educational game where a panda must collect bamboo while avoiding enemies. This project is designed for AP Computer Science A students to learn and practice object-oriented programming concepts in an engaging way.

## Greenfoot Scenario

This repository includes a complete **Greenfoot-compatible scenario** that can be opened and run directly in Greenfoot.

👉 **[Get Started with the Greenfoot Scenario →](greenfoot-scenario/)**

### Quick Start

1. Install [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/) (free download)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open Greenfoot and go to `Scenario` → `Open...`
4. Navigate to the `greenfoot-scenario` folder
5. Start playing and modifying the code!

## Documentation

- 📖 **[Complete Setup Guide](greenfoot-scenario/README_GREENFOOT.md)** - Detailed instructions for opening, running, and modifying the game
- 📝 **[Migration Notes](greenfoot-scenario/MIGRATION_NOTES.md)** - Technical details about the Greenfoot conversion
- 🎨 **[Image Guidelines](greenfoot-scenario/images/README.md)** - How to add custom graphics

## What's Included

- ✅ **5 Java Classes**: PandaWorld, Panda, Bamboo, Enemy, Wall
- ✅ **Complete Game Mechanics**: Movement, collision detection, scoring, win/lose conditions
- ✅ **Greenfoot-Compatible**: No external dependencies, ready to run
- ✅ **Well-Documented**: Inline comments and comprehensive guides
- ✅ **Educational Focus**: Perfect for learning OOP concepts

## Learning Objectives

This project helps students learn:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
- **Game Development**: Game loops (act method), collision detection, user input handling
- **Problem Solving**: Algorithm design, debugging, code organization
- **Software Design**: Class relationships, method design, documentation

## Game Overview

**Objective**: Control the panda to collect all bamboo while avoiding enemies

**Controls**: 
- Arrow Keys → Move the panda

**Win Condition**: 
- Collect all 5 bamboo items

**Lose Condition**: 
- Get hit by enemies 3 times

**Features**:
- Health system with invincibility after taking damage
- Moving enemies with patrol AI
- Score tracking
- Wall obstacles and boundaries

## Extending the Game

The scenario is designed to be easily modified. Students can:

- Change movement speed and game difficulty
- Add new actor types (power-ups, different enemies)
- Create multiple levels
- Implement animation and sound effects
- Add advanced AI behaviors
- Create menu screens and UI elements

See [README_GREENFOOT.md](greenfoot-scenario/README_GREENFOOT.md) for modification ideas and guidance.

## Requirements

- **Greenfoot**: Version 3.0.0 or higher (free download from [greenfoot.org](https://www.greenfoot.org/))
- **Java**: Included with Greenfoot
- **Images**: Optional (instructions provided for using built-in Greenfoot images)

## Support

For help with setup or usage:
1. Check the [troubleshooting section](greenfoot-scenario/README_GREENFOOT.md#troubleshooting) in the setup guide
2. Review inline code comments in the Java files
3. Consult the [Greenfoot documentation](https://www.greenfoot.org/doc)
