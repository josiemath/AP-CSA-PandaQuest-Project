## Where to Find Images:

You can:
- Create your own pixel art images
- Use free sprite resources from:
  - OpenGameArt.org
  - Kenney.nl (game assets)
  - Itch.io (free game assets)
- Draw simple shapes in a graphics editor
- Use Greenfoot's built-in image library as placeholders

## Using Greenfoot's Built-in Images (Temporary Placeholders):

If you don't have custom images yet, you can use Greenfoot's built-in images:
- For Panda: Use "bee.png" or "elephant.png" temporarily
- For Bamboo: Use "wombat.png" or "bamboo.png" if available
- For Enemy: Use "ladybug.png" or "ant.png"
- For Wall: Use "brick.jpg" or "steel.jpg"

Simply change the image file names in the .java files to match what's available.
